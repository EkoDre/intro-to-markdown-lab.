# How to Write an HTML Boilerplate

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a basic HTML template that you can use as a starting point for any webpage. An HTML boilerplate contains all the elements that every HTML document needs.

## 1. The Basic Structure

An HTML document usually starts with a declaration and includes important sections:

1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5.
2. **`<html lang="en">`**: The root element of the HTML document. The attribute `lang="en"` sets the language to English.
3. **`<head>`**: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title, character set, and links to CSS files.
4. **`<body>`**: Contains the content that will be displayed on the webpage.

***Example:***

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
  <p>This is a basic HTML boilerplate.</p>
</body>
</html>
